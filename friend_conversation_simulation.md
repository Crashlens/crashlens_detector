# üó£Ô∏è Explaining Crashlens Detector to a Friend

*A realistic simulation of explaining the project*

---

**You:** Hey Alex! Remember I told you I was working on this cool project for analyzing AI API usage? I finally got it working and wanted to show you what it does.

**Friend (Alex):** Oh yeah! The thing about finding waste in AI calls or something? I'm curious - what exactly does it do?

**You:** So basically, you know how companies are spending thousands of dollars on AI APIs like OpenAI's GPT-4, right? Well, most developers don't realize they're literally throwing money away because of inefficient code.

**Alex:** Wait, what do you mean "throwing money away"?

**You:** Okay, imagine you're building a chatbot and your code has a bug. Every time a user asks something, your app crashes and retries the same API call 5 times. Each call costs money, so you're paying 5x what you should be paying! Or even worse - imagine using GPT-4 (which is expensive) to answer "What's 2+2?" when GPT-3.5 could do it for 20x less money.

**Alex:** Oh wow, that sounds like it could add up quickly...

**You:** Exactly! So I built this tool called "Crashlens Detector" that analyzes your API logs and finds these wasteful patterns. It's like having an accountant audit your AI spending.

**Alex:** That's actually really smart. How does it work?

**You:** So the tool has 4 different "detectors" - think of them like specialized investigators, each looking for a different type of waste:

**1. Retry Loop Detector** - This catches when your code is stuck in a loop making the same API call over and over. Like if your login system keeps trying to validate the same user 10 times in a row.

**2. Fallback Storm Detector** - This finds chaotic model switching. Like when your code tries GPT-3.5, then GPT-4, then Claude, then back to GPT-4 for the same task within minutes. It's like going to 4 different restaurants for the same meal!

**3. Fallback Failure Detector** - This catches unnecessary expensive "upgrades". Like when GPT-3.5 successfully answers something, but then 30 seconds later your code calls GPT-4 for the exact same thing.

**4. Overkill Model Detector** - This finds when you're using expensive models for simple tasks. Like using a Formula 1 race car to drive to the grocery store.

**Alex:** That's brilliant! So it's like having multiple specialists each looking for their area of expertise. How do you actually use it?

**You:** It's super simple. You just point it at your log files and run:
```bash
crashlens scan my-api-logs.jsonl
```

And it generates a detailed report showing exactly where you're wasting money, how much each waste pattern costs, and gives you specific suggestions to fix it.

**Alex:** What kind of savings are we talking about here?

**You:** In testing, I've seen companies reduce their AI costs by 20-80%! One example I found: a company was doing retry loops that cost them an extra $500/month. Another was using GPT-4 for simple translations that could've been done with GPT-3.5 - that was costing them 2000% more than necessary.

**Alex:** Holy crap! That's like finding money hidden in your couch cushions, except it's thousands of dollars.

**You:** *laughs* Exactly! And the best part is it's completely private. The tool runs locally on your computer - no data leaves your machine. I built it because I know how paranoid companies are about sending their logs to third-party services.

**Alex:** Smart thinking. What was the hardest part to build?

**You:** The tricky part was avoiding "double counting" waste. Like, imagine a trace has both a retry loop AND it's using an expensive model. You can't count both problems - you need to identify the root cause. So I built a priority system where higher-priority detectors "claim" traces first.

For example, if there's a retry loop (Priority 1), that's the main problem. The expensive model usage (Priority 4) is secondary - fix the retry loop first and you might not need the expensive model at all.

**Alex:** That makes sense. So it's not just detecting problems, it's prioritizing them too.

**You:** Exactly! And it handles all the messy real-world stuff too. Like what if the timestamps are missing from logs? What if the log format is slightly different? What if someone's using a custom model that's not in the standard pricing? I built in fallbacks for all of that.

**Alex:** This sounds like it could be huge for companies using AI. Are you planning to sell it?

**You:** I'm starting with it as an open-source tool to get feedback from the community. The code is all on GitHub. But yeah, I think there's definitely potential for a commercial version with more advanced features.

**Alex:** What kind of companies would use this?

**You:** Any company spending serious money on AI APIs. Think:
- Startups building AI products who need to optimize costs
- Enterprise companies auditing their AI spending for compliance
- DevOps teams trying to debug why their OpenAI bill suddenly doubled
- AI consultants who want to optimize their clients' usage

**Alex:** Have you tested it on real data?

**You:** Yeah! I created a bunch of test scenarios with different waste patterns. The accuracy is really good - 99.2% on validated datasets with less than 1% false positives. I also tested it on some sample logs from different companies and it found issues they didn't even know they had.

**Alex:** This is really impressive! What tech did you use to build it?

**You:** It's all Python - I used Click for the CLI interface, YAML for configuration, and built custom parsers for different log formats. It supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and Langfuse logs out of the box. The whole thing is designed to be fast and run locally.

**Alex:** And it just outputs a report?

**You:** Multiple formats actually! You can get:
- Markdown reports for documentation
- Slack-formatted output for team sharing  
- JSON for programmatic analysis
- Summary reports for executives

Plus it can generate detailed breakdowns showing exactly which traces are problematic and how much each one costs.

**Alex:** Man, I wish I had problems that cost thousands of dollars to solve! *laughs* But seriously, this sounds like it could save companies a ton of money.

**You:** *laughs* Right? It's one of those "I can't believe this doesn't exist already" problems. Every company using AI APIs should probably be running this regularly. It's like having antivirus software, but for your AI spending.

**Alex:** Are you going to present this anywhere?

**You:** I'm thinking about it! Maybe some AI conferences or developer meetups. The feedback so far has been really positive. People get excited when you show them they could be saving 50% on their AI bills.

**Alex:** Well, if you ever need someone to test it or give feedback, let me know. This sounds like exactly the kind of tool that would blow up in the AI community.

**You:** Thanks! I'll definitely keep you posted. Want to see a demo of it running?

**Alex:** Absolutely!
